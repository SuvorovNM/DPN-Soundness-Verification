# DPN Soundness Verification App

The toolkit allowing to verify data-aware soundness of DPNs with composite input/output conditions. 
Conditions may be of variable-operator-constant and variable-operator-variable forms.
Model is imported in the extended PNML format, input examples are presented in DataPetriNetOnSmt.Visualization\Samples_For_Import.
For the input model, a transition system highlighting sources of unsoundness is constructed.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- .NET SDK 6.0.407
